# Virtual Mouse

🖱️ Virtual AI Mouse with Voice & Gesture Control
Control your computer like Tony Stark — no physical mouse required.
🚀 What It Does
- 👋 Hand Gesture Recognition: Move the cursor, click, and drag using just your fingers
- 🎙️ Voice Commands: Perform actions like "open browser" or "scroll down" using speech
- 🧠 AI-Powered Tracking: Uses computer vision and deep learning for real-time hand and voice input
- 🖥️ Touchless Interaction: Designed for accessibility, hygiene, and futuristic user experience
🛠️ Built With
- Python & OpenCV for computer vision
- MediaPipe for hand landmark detection
- Vosk for offline voice recognition
- PyAutoGUI for simulating mouse and keyboard actions
🌟 Highlights
- No external hardware required — just a webcam and mic
- Works offline (no internet needed for voice control)
- Modular codebase for easy extension (e.g., add custom gestures or commands)
